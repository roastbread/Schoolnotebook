1. Any constant errors are exponentially increased by integration, until they reach infinity.

2. Get a better sensor, calibrate the sensor often or fuse the sensor signal with another.

3. If the sensor is saturated there will be information loss that will transfer to the integration rendering the data useless.

4. In a noisy signal a derivation will potentialy record great changes in the signal even if the signal is stedy. If a robot arm with a noisy angle sensor is stationary, a derivated signal would record high speed in both direcions.

5. --||--

6. Use a low pass filter to remove high frequencies that play havoc with the derivation

7. In sampled systems a long sample time will behave like a low-pass filter and for shorter sample times the signal approaces a continous.

8. The dynamic of a sensor becomes relevant when you have specific dynamics for an application that needs to be matched.

9. If the application is time dependant, and potentially with high frequencies.

10. Plot a step response of the sensor and calculate its dynamics.

11. It would be unable to detect small changes in velocity.

12. It would be able to handle the sensing task on its own without the need for other sensors or signal processing.
